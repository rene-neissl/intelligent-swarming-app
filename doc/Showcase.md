# Showcase

This document describes the environment which is used for developing, testing and demonstrating the **Intelligent Swarming App**.

## Product

**Analytics as a Service** is an application that allows you to track telemetry data from various client applications. The **AaaS**-Server provides a web-frontend to visualize the recorded telemetry data using diagrams and/or sortable and searchable lists. **AaaS**-Server and **AaaS**-Frontend run within separated Docker containers. **AaaS** also offers an *SDK* that can be used by third party organizations in order to integrate a client into **AaaS**. The web-frontend allows users to set up triggers. A trigger monitors new telemetry data and sends a notification (email) in case of anomalies in the data.

## Possible Issues

- Questions on setup of AaaS-Server.
- AaaS-Server not starting.
- Web-Frontend not available.
- Questions on Client-SDK.
- Triggers not working.
